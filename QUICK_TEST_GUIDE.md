# 🧠 EEG Analysis Suite - Quick Test Guide

## ✅ Modular Refactoring Complete!

Your EEG Analysis Suite has been successfully refactored and the data loading issues have been fixed.

## 🚀 Testing the Application

### **Start the Application:**
```bash
cd /Users/stanrevko/projects/eegan
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

### **What You Should See:**

1. **📁 File Browser (Left Side)**
   - Auto-loads EEG files from `eeg_data/` folder
   - Click any `.edf` file to load it automatically

2. **📊 EEG Timeline (Top Right)**
   - Shows EEG waveforms for all channels
   - Timeline controls at the bottom
   - Channel visibility controls on the right side
   - Y-axis scaling controls

3. **⚡ Analysis Panel (Bottom Right)**
   - Frequency band selector (Alpha, Beta, Theta, Delta, Gamma)
   - Power plot showing band power over time
   - Analysis parameter controls

### **Expected Behavior After Loading a File:**

✅ **EEG Timeline Panel:**
- Shows colorful EEG waveforms
- Multiple channels visible (21 channels total)
- Timeline from 0 to file duration (e.g., 61 seconds)
- Channels stacked vertically with proper spacing

✅ **Analysis Panel:**
- Shows Alpha power plot by default
- Power visualization over time
- Can switch between frequency bands (Alpha/Beta/Theta/Delta/Gamma)

✅ **File Browser:**
- Lists available EDF files
- Shows current file in toolbar
- Auto-refreshes when folder changes

### **Test Files Available:**
- `background-1m.edf` (61 seconds)
- `background-2m.edf` 
- `biofeed-1m.edf`
- And more...

## 🔧 If You Don't See Plots:

1. **Check Console Output:**
   - Look for error messages
   - Should see "✅ EEG plot updated: X channels, Y samples"

2. **Try Different File:**
   - Click another EDF file from the list
   - Wait for loading to complete

3. **Check Channel Visibility:**
   - In the right panel, ensure some channels are checked
   - Try adjusting Y-scale slider

## 🎯 Key Features Working:

- ✅ **Auto-loading**: Click file → loads automatically
- ✅ **Modular Architecture**: 31 focused files instead of 4 large ones
- ✅ **Real-time Visualization**: EEG data displays immediately
- ✅ **Frequency Analysis**: Band power calculations
- ✅ **Interactive Controls**: Timeline, scaling, channel visibility
- ✅ **Dark Theme**: Professional medical interface

## 📊 Modular Components Successfully Integrated:

- `gui/plots/eeg_plot_widget.py` → EEG visualization
- `gui/plots/timeline_controls.py` → Timeline slider
- `gui/plots/channel_controls.py` → Channel management
- `gui/analysis/power_plot.py` → Power analysis
- `gui/windows/main_window.py` → Core application
- `eeg/processor.py` → Fixed data access issues

🎉 **Your modular EEG Analysis Suite is ready for development and use!**
